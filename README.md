# Cassiopeia-Starlighter

## Description

**cassiopeia-starlighter** is an npm library designed to facilitate interaction with the Cassiopeia Database swiftly and effortlessly. It provides a set of tools for managing authentication, registration, file uploads, and downloads with the database.

**cassiopeia-database** does not have a website yet, and is currently in beta testing. As a reminder, this is a free file storage for any files up to 15mb. Please do not abuse the database. Use it only for its intended purpose. If your account is seen to be using the database in a dishonest or harmful way, it will be irretrievably deleted automatically.
